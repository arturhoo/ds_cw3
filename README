This package contains the source code for multiple exercises of Coursework 3.

Here is a brief description of each folder:

- eclipse_project/: folder containing the eclipse project
|- bin/: binaries for the implementation
|- libs/: libraries necessary for the project
|- src/: source code for the implementation
- ws1_weather/: stub for the first web service
- ws2_celsius/: stub for the second web service


This coursework was developed using the Eclipse IDE.

All the libraries necessary for the correct run of the program are located
in the folder eclipse/libs/.

To use the program please import the eclipse_project/ folder into eclipse
It is also needed to set up the argument for the program, this being an
US valid ZIP, such as New York City's 10153.

A file will be created, named <result.html> which is a static HTML page
containing the current temperature for that zip in Celsius unit,

The basic functionality of this program is retrieve the current temperature
of a US ZIP code in Fahrenheit units and then use this temperature with
another web service that converts Fehrenheit to Celsius to display the
ZIP's temperature.
